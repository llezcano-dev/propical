/** Find events / reservations the current selection (a contiguous
 *  range startDate → endDate, inclusive) could be appended to. The
 *  returned bookings carry their own startDate / endDate so the
 *  side panel can show the host the full context (platform, guest
 *  name, original stay window) before they confirm.
 *
 *  Adjacency rules — both based on the day immediately outside the
 *  bar's visible range:
 *    * "before" — the day AFTER the selected range equals the
 *                 booking's startDate (= clickedRange ends one day
 *                 before bar.startDate).
 *    * "after"  — the FIRST selected day equals booking.endDate + 1
 *                 (= clickedRange starts one day after bar.endDate).
 *
 *  Both rules require the click to be OUTSIDE the bar — the popover
 *  hides the extend section when any selected date is on a bar
 *  (`bulkCounts.booked === 0` gate), so adjacency rules that fired
 *  on the bar's own end cells could never surface. Previous
 *  behaviour did exactly that with the "after" rule
 *  (`endDate === clickedStart`) and was effectively dead code; the
 *  rule above is the correct adjacent-cell version.
