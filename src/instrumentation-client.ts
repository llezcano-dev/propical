// every page on every site and frequently throw `addListener` /
// `emit is undefined` errors during their internal init race. Those
// errors fire whether or not the user has visited a crypto site —
// they pollute every Sentry stream that doesn't filter them. None
// originate from Propical code, so dropping them at the SDK keeps
// the alert list focused on signals we can act on.
//
// Two filters layered for redundancy:
//   - denyUrls: any frame in an extension URL or a known injected
//     bundle path is dropped before transmission.
//   - ignoreErrors: textual fingerprints of the common extension
//     errors that leak through with empty/missing stack frames.
